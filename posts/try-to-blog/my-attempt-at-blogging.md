# My Attempt at Blogging

I've wanted to start blogging since high school, but I always struggled with coming up with content. Even in university, I found myself wanting to write but not knowing what to write about.

Now, I'm making my nth attempt at consistent writing and have named my blog Car'Log[n] (short for "Carles' Log index n"). My hope is to write something that can be useful to others.

This blog is inspired by Lilian Weng's blog (which you can find [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/)). While I'm not using Hago and Paper Mod like she does, I am using Quarto as my content management system. I've tried to make my blog as similar as possible to hers (although it won't be 100% the same).

I chose Quarto because I used it in my [Sains-Data-2023](https://carlesoctav.github.io/sains-data-2023/) and [PDNum-2023](https://carlesoctav.github.io/pdnum-2023/) laboratory classes earlier this year.

I hope to be consistent in my writing.
