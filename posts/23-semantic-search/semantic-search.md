# Semantic Search / Vector Search with Transformers, is this the future of search?

## Introduction

when participating bangkit 2023, my friend and I got a chance to do company proposed capstone project (it's a project that proposed by some tech company in indonesia). we got dicoding indonesia cases, to improve discussion forum.

after a glimpse look on dicoding discussion forum, what's i feel lack in that forum are the search bar, and a proper aiding to tagging their discussion (there's just a user-based tagged, no rules).
koko
for the search engine, you need a proper match of an word /sentence for the search to able find a relevant document, not even a fuzzy search. also it's only search on title not on the body (discussion). i would say, it was a  nightmare to search as if, it's more possible to get answer with just adding new discussion (since there's a assistant that probably will answer your question ) even tho it's a duplicate.

so, for the past month (may to june) we have been researching on how we can improve search using machine learning (since it's a must as it's bangkit 2023 progam (machine learning path)) and also how to create an auto-tagger to aiding new user to properly tagging their newly disucssion.

i do work on search thingy while other do work on auto-tagger. for those who want to see all the research and finally what we have to decided to use, you guys can take a look github  [C23-DF01-Dicoding-Indonesia](https://github.com/orgs/C23-DF01-Dicoding-Indonesia/repositories) (it's not well documented so you will need to explore yourself)
