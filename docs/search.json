    "text": "My Attempt at Blogging\nI‚Äôve wanted to start blogging since high school, but I always struggled with coming up with content. Even in university, I found myself wanting to write but not knowing what to write about.\nNow, I‚Äôm making my nth attempt at consistent writing and have named my blog Car‚ÄôLog[n] (short for ‚ÄúCarles‚Äô Log index n‚Äù). My hope is to write something that can be useful to others.\nThis blog is inspired by Lilian Weng‚Äôs blog (which you can find here). While I‚Äôm not using Hago and Paper Mod like she does, I am using Quarto as my content management system. I‚Äôve tried to make my blog as similar as possible to hers (although it won‚Äôt be 100% the same).\nI chose Quarto because I used it in my Sains-Data-2023 and PDNum-2023 laboratory classes earlier this year.\nI hope to be consistent in my writing.\nCarles Octavianus\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "purpose and the values\nIn the first class of soft skills and career readiness, we discussed the importance of identifying our core values and creating a Personal Growth Plan (PGP) to achieve our goals. One of the key topics we covered was the concept of purpose.\nPurpose is what defines us as individuals. It gives us meaning, happiness, and the drive to keep going. It is what we love and what we want to achieve in our lives. Without purpose, we can easily lose our way.\nWhile it‚Äôs okay not to have a clear purpose in life yet, there are some universal truths about purpose that we should keep in mind. Purpose is something that we must actively seek out. It is a universal need that drives us to do something and make an impact on those around us. Purpose is a verb, something that we work on through service to others.\nIn conclusion, finding our purpose is essential to living a fulfilling life. It is what gives us direction and motivates us to achieve our goals. By identifying our core values and creating a PGP, we can work towards discovering our purpose and living a life that is true to ourselves.\nDuring the first class of soft skills and career readiness, we learned about the importance of identifying our personal values. Personal values are the principles and moral values that we hold true and believe in. They act as fuel that makes a person able to continue to stick to their purpose.\nWhile it‚Äôs hard to define purposes directly, we can try to define what personal values we will stick to even in the lowest point of our lives. To help us define our personal values, our instructor gave us some tips:\n\nStart by selecting 10 or even 15 values.\nNarrow down your options by asking yourself these questions for each selected value:\n\nDoes this define me?\nIs this who I am at my best?\nIs this a filter I use to make hard decisions?\n\n\nBy identifying our personal values, we can stay true to ourselves and make decisions that align with our beliefs.

    "text": "Rethinking What A Career Path Looks Like\nBefore we dive into PGP, let‚Äôs talk about career paths. When we think about career paths, we usually imagine a career ladder. But is that really what it looks like?\n\n\n\ncareer-path images, the first one shows a conventional wisdom that tells us a career path is vertical and linear (think career ladder), while the second one shows a more realistic career path that happens in real life, which is a squiggly career that isn‚Äôt limited to the conventional corporate ladder; instead, it is fluid and multi-directional.\n\n\nThe second image shows a more realistic career path that happens in real life, which is a squiggly career that isn‚Äôt limited to the conventional corporate ladder; instead, it is fluid and multi-directional. This means you can move vertically, laterally, or in a whole new direction with a different specialization altogether.\nWith the possibility of chaos, you can grow your career in many different directions. But growing your career requires a plan."

It starts with your purpose and values, and helps you determine the habits, skills, knowledge, and goals you need to achieve to live a fulfilling life. Here‚Äôs a rough guide to creating your own PGP:\n\nEstablish a clear vision by adding your values and purpose to your PGP.\nLook for development opportunities through experience, exposure, and education.\nFormulate action plans with S.M.A.R.T. goals.\nReview and evaluate your progress regularly to stay on track and make adjustments as needed."

The idea is simple: commit to one minute per day to work on your plan, and you can do more than one minute if you want to. The point is to commit to doing your plan every day, even if it‚Äôs just for one minute. This is better than committing to one hour but only on a monthly basis."
