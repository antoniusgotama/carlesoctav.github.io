I am a senior mathematics student deeply interested in developing machine learning-driven solutions. I have experience using TensorFlow and PyTorch, specializing in NLP models for information retrieval. I also have experience working with ML infrastructure in GCP. I am passionate about enhancing search experiences through natural interactions with AI-powered search engines. Currently, I am actively seeking an ML-related internship, such as an ML Engineering or Data Scientist position.
